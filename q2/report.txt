Explanation of Question ->
n->Pharmaceutical Companies
Each company takes w seconds to prepare r batches having p vaccines.Each vaccine of this company has xi probability. They will distribute the vaccine to the vaccination zone and wait for all its batches produced to get used.
m->Vaccination Zones
Each Zone waits to recieve 1 batch of vaccine from any company and then it will create k slots and wait for students to arrive when some students arrive it will vaccinate less than or equal to k .while it is vaccinating it will not create new slots.
o->Students
Each student waits for a zone to create a slot where he can move. after he gets the vaccine he gets an antibody test, if he test positive for antibody he can now leave the process but if he test negative for antibody , he has to repeat this process again.he can get vaccine maximum of 3 times.

Explanation of Logic & Code->
1) Structs ->
	a) Company ->denoting Pharmaceutical Companies
		int id; // denoting number of company 1-n
	    int r;//number of batches
	    int p;//number of vaccine in each batch
	    int x;//probability of vaccine
	    char s[6];//stores the status for each batch(P-produced ; G-given to zone ;D-distributed)
	    pthread_t c_tid;//defining thread
	    pthread_mutex_t c_mutex;//defining mutex
	    pthread_cond_t c_cond;//defining condition variable
	b) Zone    ->denoting Vaccination Zone
		int id; // denoting number of zone 1-m
		int c_id; // denoting number of company who produced the batch for this zone.
		int s_id[10]; //denoting the ids of student given vaccine.
		int k;//number of slots
		int b;//slots left
		int g;//number of vaccine left in that zone
		int h;//currently number of students left with test having vaccine.
		int v;//status of zone(0-waiting for company; 1-already have ; 2-waiting for stud)
		char s[10];//stores the status for each slot(C-created ; A-assigned)
		pthread_t z_tid;//defining thread
	    pthread_mutex_t z_mutex;//defining mutex
	    pthread_cond_t z_cond;//defining condition variable
	    pthread_cond_t z_cond1;//defining condition variable
	c) Student ->denoting students
		int id; // denoting number of student 1-o
		int z_id; // denoting number of zone where he gets vaccinated.
		int count;//number of times he is vaccinated
		int v;//status for student(0-waiting ; 1-given ; 2-done) 
		pthread_t s_tid;//defining thread
	    pthread_mutex_t s_mutex;//defining mutex
	    pthread_cond_t s_cond;//defining condition variable

2) Variables used ->
	int n;//number of companies
	int m;//number of zones
	int o;//number of students
	Company *Comp ;//Company struct
	Zone *Zon;//Zone struct
	Student *Stud ;//Student struct
	int a;//number of students currently available .
	int su=0;//number of students successfully vaccinated .

3) Functions used ->
	a) void* Prod_vaccine(void* input) -> this function is used to implement role of Pharmaceutical
	Companies.if the number of current batches are not zero it will wait till its all batches are used. If 
	the batches are zero then it will prepare r batches(1-5) having vaccine (10-20) in each batch 
	by taking w second(2-5) then it will signal all the zones who dont have any batch and currently 
	not in vaccination phase to come to take batch.
	each thread will do this function till a>0

	b) void* Get_vaccine(void* input) -> this function is used to implement role of students. If student does not get any 
	slot it will wait till any vaccination zone give it a signal that slot is ready it will wait.when it gets the slot 
	flag v=1 then their will be antibodies test for each company probability is given ,consider new probability as 
	probability*100 and then generate random variable between 1-100 if the variable <= probability then he will test 
	positive for antibodies and here function end for this .else he will test negative for antibodies and then again come 
	to zone.after that it will signal the zone that vaccination is done . it will do this function till either he tested positive for antibodies or all 3 chances are over.

	c)  void* Dist_vaccine(void* input) -> this function is used to implement Vaccination Zones.
	if flag =0 then it will search for a company if any company doesnot have any batch left it will give signal to 
	company (using pthread_cond_signal) and the zone will wait for a company to produce a batch and signal the zone for 
	batch is prepared .if flag = 2 that means vaccination phase is going it will wait for students to end their 
	vaccination.if flag = 1 that is it have a batch or any slot made previously has left then if slots are left then it 
	will use these slots otherwise it will create new slot (1-min(8,students left,vaccines left in zone)) then it will 
	find students who are left with their vaccination zone will choose the students and then signal them that you are 
	given a slot.this function also continues till students leave.
