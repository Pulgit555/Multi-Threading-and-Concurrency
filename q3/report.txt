Explanation of Question ->
There are a acoustic and e electric stages , k musicians who can perform on a specific stage or can perform on both the stages, they will perform for a random  time t' , whereas singers can perform solo or can join other musician also and increases the time of performance of the musician by 2 sec.After arriving they will not wait for more than t sec and they will leave Srujana. After that there are c coordinators who will take 2 secs to give t-shirts to artist who performed on stage .

Explanation of Logic & Code->
1) Structs ->
	a) Artists
		int id;//id of the artist
		int s_id;//id for the stage
		char name[50];//name of artist
		char instrument;//instrument character
		int fl;//fl=1 for acoustic , fl=2 for electric
		int v; // v=1 for allowed , v=2 goes back
		int time;//time in secs of arrival
		pthread_t a_tid1;//defining thread for acoustic
		pthread_t a_tid2;//defining other thread for electric
		pthread_t a_tid3;//defining thread for timeout
		pthread_mutex_t a_mutex;//defining mutex
		pthread_mutex_t a_mutex1;//defining mutex
		pthread_cond_t a_cond;//defining condition variable
		pthread_cond_t a_cond2;//defining condition variable
	b) Stages
		int id;//id of stage
		int a_id;//id of artist
		int s_id;//id of singer
	Artists *Artist;//Artist(Musicians+Singers) Struct
	Stages *E_Stage;//electric Stage struct
	Stages *A_Stage;//acoustic Stage struct

2) Variables ->
	int a;//number of acoustic stages.
	int e;//number of electric stages.
	int k;//number of musicians and singers.
	int t1;//minimum duration of performance.
	int t2;//maximum duration of performance.
	int t;//waiting time for artists.
	int c;//number of coordinators.

3) Semaphores -> 
	sem_t acoustic;//semaphore for acoustic stages
	sem_t electric;//semaphore for electric stages
	sem_t coordinators;//semaphore for coordinators.

4) Differnts Roles of Artists and functions used for tehm->
	Check function -> this is used to check whether a performer wait for more than t secs or not by using clock_gettime(
	CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts) to get current relative time and then using pthread_cond_wait() , this thread will wait for
	other artist thread to either signal this wait condition when he gets empty stage or after specified t secs it will 
	automatically get over. and then if time taken in getting the stage is less than t then it will set the flag(A->v) to 
	1 else to 2.implemented in line(368-391)

	1) Musicians who palys violin ('v') only perform on acoustic stage . So they wait for 1 acoustic stage to get empty(
	using sem_wait(&acoustic)) using semaphore acoustic. After getting an empty stage ,check for time taken in getting 
	stage if time taken is greater than t sec then he will leave Srujana.If time is less than t sec then he/she will 
	perform for t' secs(which is found using rand() from t1-t2). after his performance he will check whether any singer 
	joined the stage or not . If singer joined then performance will increase by 2 secs otherwise performance end then 
	only and then he/she leave the stage and wait for 1 coordinator to get t shirt and coordinator will take 2 secs to
	 give t-shirt and after that he will leave.This is implemented using acousti function from line (469-546). 

	2) Musicians who play bass('b') only perform on electric stage and similar to point(1) I implemented this using
	 function electri from line(392-468).

	3) Musicians who play piano('p') and guitar('g') , they can perform on both acoustic and electric stages . first we 
	need to ckeck on which stage musician perform electric or acoustic , for that I am using flag (A->fl) and semaphores (
	acoustic and electric ) .Whichever empty stage he/she gets first
	will change the flag and that stage gets fixed and on other stage using sem_post he/she can leave that if the stage 
	is electric , logic is same as case of 2 and if the stage is acoustic , logic is same as case of 1.
	this is implemented using electric_i and acoustic_i function. from line(186-367).
	
	4) Singers are special cases , They will choose randomly id from (1-a+e) as kk if kk>a then it will go to electrical 
	else it will go to acoustic.when it is in electrical or acoustic it will check whether at that stage is there any 
	other artist also then it will join the performance otherwise it will do solo performance.after performing it will 
	wait for the coordinator to give him/her a t-shirt. and all other logic is same as point (1). in function 
	musical_mayhem from line(46-185).
